                <p class="faq-item-info">Not sure if a mechanical engineer is what you’re looking for? At the most basic level a mechanical engineer provides engineering services related to movement. If you’re trying to create or patent anything related to the construction of machinery, tools, or a consumer invention then a mechanical engineer probably fits your job. Contractual engineering has extensive network that offers experts in computer aided design (CAD) (Solidworks, Fusion 360), 3D printing, machinery, robotics, medical devices, manufacturing, industrial equipment, instrumentation, aerospace i.e. drones, hydraulics, pneumatics, pressure vessels, gears, bearings, belts and pulleys, power screws, fits and tolerances, codes and standards, strength of materials,  Fluid dynamics, Thermodynamics, Heat Transfer,  Heating ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC), psychrometrics, refrigeration, heat exchangers, condensers / evaporators, compressors, combustion, pumps, actuators, boilers, composites, American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards and codes, Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) standards and codes,  vibration, professional engineering review and stamping, consulting on design recommendations and many more.</p>

                <h5 class="faq-item-header">Civil Engineering</h5>
                <p class="faq-item-info">Not sure if a civil engineer is what you’re looking for? A civil engineer’s primary focus is to design and build, generally large non-moving structures. Although the civil engineering discipline covers a wide verity projects at the most basic level the majority of work is designing (buildings, bridges, houses, tunnels, utilities, dams, highways and roads) the infrastructure for the economy. This infrastructure encompasses five main categories: civil construction, geotechnical, structural, transportation, water resources and environmental. If your trying to design a new tree house, boat dock or gazebo for your backyard, make an addition to your home, or build a coffee shop around the corner a civil engineer is what you may need. Since safety is of upmost importance and most of these projects have human life in, on or around, state codes often require a Professional Engineer to review and certify designs are safe. *For warning, most civil projects will require a Professional Engineer to review and stamp (certify) any designs. This allows the requester (you) to transfer liability of your design failing to the hands of a licensed engineer. Contractual Engineering offers a variety of services to facilitate any sort of civil engineering request. Some of our most popular services include engineering designs using CAD software (Revit, Civil 3D, or Solidworks), structural analysis, geotechnical surveying, professional engineering review and stamping, and lastly consulting on design, feasibility studies and cost estimating.<br><br>

                <h5 class="faq-item-header">Electrical Engineering</h5>
                <p class="faq-item-info">Not sure if an Electrical Engineer is what you’re looking for? Electrical engineering has a wide variety of specialties in the engineering field. The discipline is generally broken down into two sections, electrical power or controls and communication. Many engineering projects have great overlap between mechanical, electrical and computer disciplines, but often electrical or computer is just a piece of the puzzle to the overall project. You may want to select an electrical engineer only if the majority of your project is related to electrical or control design. For example: If you are trying to install new lighting in your garage, you want to upgrade your power panel, you need help designing an electrical circuit or circuit board or your trying to use a programmable logic controller (PLC) then an electrical engineer should be your choice. If you believe the majority of the work of your project falls in a different category, please select a different discipline. The engineer that will conduct most of the work for your project will bring further expertise on board when needed. Furthermore, Contractual Engineering offers expertise in anything related to circuit analysis, measurement and instrumentation, safety and reliability, signal processing, digital systems, digital logic, digital components, electromagnetics, electromagnetic fields, guided waves, antennas, electronics, electronic circuits, electronic components and applications, control systems, analysis and design of analog or digital control systems, communications, modulation techniques, noise and interference, communication systems, codes and standards (NFPA 70, NEC, ANSI c2, NESC, NFPA 70E), transformers, lighting, surge protection, hazardous area classification (NFPA 497, 499, 30B), three phase circuits, alternating current (AC), direct current (DC), devices and power electronic circuits, rotating machines and electrical power devices, induction and synchronous machines, transmission and distribution, protection, fault current analysis, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standards and codes, professional engineering review and stamping, consulting on design recommendations and many more.

                <p class="faq-item-info">Not sure if a computer engineer, a programmer or a scientist is what you’re looking for? Since the creation of the what we now consider a modern computer (thanks to Alan Turning’s “Turning Machine” in 1936) there has been an explosion of applications and uses for these wonderful tools. As this is one of the broadest categories of engineering / fields, it can be sometimes hard to classify exactly what set of skills or expertise one shall need. There is great overlap between electrical engineers and computer engineers as they work closely to develop these magnificent processing machines. At the most basic level if you need help with anything related to computers, computer programming, purchasing computers or software, designing a new app, programming a CNC machine or setting up a cryptocurrency mining operation a computer engineer, programmer or scientist is what you may need.
